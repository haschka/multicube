* This are some general guidelines on how to get multicube running on
* your machine.  
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

Multicube has only been extensively tested on Nvidia's and Apple's OpenCL
implementation, in double precision.

By default the code presented runs on GPUs, if you want to run this code on a 
CPU you may search and replace in the multicube.c file the word 
    CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU 
with 
    CL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU 

To compile this code you should write something like:
(for large molecules and in general double precision is prefered)
on Linux:

gcc -O2 multicube.c -o multicube -lm -lOpenCL -D_DDOUBLE

on Mac OS X: 

gcc -O2 -framework OpenCL multicube.c -o multicube -D_DDOUBLE

For small molecules and if you want to test this on a gpu without double
precision support you may omit -D_DDOUBLE from the above. 

Instructions how to use this will automatically appear if you run multicube
without any parameters. 

Running Multicube make sure that in the folder from
where you start this program you have the spot.cl and dpot.cl file stored.

A test-set for the alanine molecule is provided with this program.
The testset can be run using the following command:

./multicube HCN.charge HCN.vdw charges-out 1 1 1. 0.0000001 0.00000001 100000 HCN.chk.fchk.80.cube

For a starting point:

./multicube yourinital-charges yourvdw-radii charges-output 1 1 1. 0.0000001 0.00000001 100000 your-cube-files-containing-the-potential

should yield good values for double precision calculations.


Argument list:
-------------

1. string = /path/to/chargesfile 
2. string = /path/to/vdw_database 
3. string = /path/to/minimized_charges_output 
4  int    = Number of GPUs you have... >1000 is cool! 
5. char   = Norm to use 1: L1 2: L2 3: weighted L1 4: weighted L2
6. real   = Initial stepsize ~1 should be fine otherwise use thumbs devided by Pi
                                          f(x+h)-f(x-h)
7. real   = h used in numerical gradient : -------------
                                               2*h     
                     should be around sqrtf(machine_epsilon)
                     machine_epsilon= for 64bit doubles ~1.11e-16
                                      for 32bit floats  ~5.96e-08
8. real   = convergence criterium: 
             calculation stops if: 
             displacement_vector_length < convergence criterium
9. int    = maximum number of steps to evaluate
10. multiple stings = /paths/to/cubes/*.cube
    	     	      (i.e. all following arguments are treated
    	     	      as cube files)


Specific parameters:
-------------------
yourinital-charges-file:
The number of lines in your initial charge file has to correspond to the number
of atoms in your cube files. Each line should contain a three letter code 
describing the atomtype followed by the initial guess charge. Atoms containing
the same three letter code are automatically treated to be of the same type and 
will have the same charge in charges-output. The file shall not end on a new
line as this currently crashes the program.

yourvdw-radii:
In this file you have to define the vdw radii for all your atomtypes used in
the yourinitial-charges-file. Each line should contain a three letter code 
defining the atomtype followed by the vdw radius for this atom type. The file
shall not end on a new line as this currently crashes the program.

*      Changing of metrics                                                    *
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*

Our algorithm is not limited to those implemented and
different metrics can be used in simply changing the functions defined
in the OpenCL kernel functions in the files spot.cl and
dpot.cl supplied with the source code. This is as simple as
changing lines 68 and 70 in dpot.cl.
